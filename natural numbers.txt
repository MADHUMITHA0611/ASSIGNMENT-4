Output
Alphabets from (A-Z) are:
A B C D E F G H I J K L M N O P Q R S T U V W X Y Z 
Alphabets from (a-z) are:
a b c d e f g h i j k l m n o p q r s t u v w x y z 
















Program to print (A to Z) and (a to z) using for loop
In the below program,

For loop is used to print the alphabets from A to Z. A loop variable is taken to do this of type ‘char’. 
The loop variable ‘i’ is initialized with the first alphabet ‘A’ and incremented by 1 on every iteration.
In the loop, the character ‘i’ is printed as the alphabet.
Program: 


// C++ program to find the print
// Alphabets from A to Z
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;
 
int main()
{
    // Declare the variables
    char i;
 
    // Display the alphabets
    cout << "The Alphabets from A to Z are: \n";
 
    // Traverse each character
    // with the help of for loop
    for (i = 'A'; i <= 'Z'; i++) {
        // Print the alphabet
        cout << i << " ";
    }
    // Display the alphabets
    cout << "\nThe Alphabets from a to z are: \n";
    for (i = 'a'; i <= 'z'; i++) {
        // Print the alphabet
        cout << i << " ";
    }
 
    return 0;
}

The Alphabets from a to z are: 
a b c d e f g h i j k l m n o p q r s t u v w x y z 
















Program to print (A to Z) and (a to z) using the while loop
In the below program,

While loop is used to print the alphabets from A to Z. A loop variable is taken to display of type ‘char’. 
The loop variable ‘i’ is initialized with the first alphabet ‘A’ and incremented by 1 on every iteration.
In the loop, the character ‘i’ is printed as the alphabet.
// C++ program to find the print
// Alphabets from A to Z
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;
 
int main()
{
    // Declare the variables
    char i;
 
    // Display the alphabets
    cout << "The Alphabets from A to Z are: \n";
 
    // Traverse each character
    // with the help of while loop
    i = 'A';
 
    while (i <= 'Z') {
        cout << i << ' ';
        i++;
    }
    // Display the alphabets
    i = 'a';
 
    cout << "\nThe Alphabets from a to z are: \n";
 
    while (i <= 'z') {
        cout << i << ' ';
        i++;
    }

Program to print (A to Z) and (a to z) using a do-while loop
In the below program,

The do-while loop is used to print the alphabets from A to Z. A loop variable is taken to display of type ‘char’. 
The loop variable ‘i’ is initialized with the first alphabet ‘A’ and incremented by 1 on every iteration.
In the loop, the character ‘i’ is printed as the alphabet.

// C++ program to find the print

    // Traverse each character
    // with the help of while loop
    i = 'A';
 
    do{
        cout << i << ' ';
        i++;
    }while (i <= 'Z');
    // Display the alphabets
    i = 'a';
 
    cout << "\nThe Alphabets from a to z are: \n";
